Four local LLMs serve different roles:
- `llama3:8b` — summarization only (the SOT extractor)
- `llama3.1:8b` — advisor (per-section study guides from the SOT)
- `llama3.2` — conversational roles (quiz generator, teacher aide, teacher, general chat)
- `mistral` — quiz grading (judge-separated from the quiz generator)

Everything runs on a single Mac. There are no remote calls beyond Ollama on `localhost`.

## The Source of Truth (SOT)

The SOT is the canonical data abstraction the entire system orbits.

**Storage:** one JSON file at `backend/memory_store.json`. An array of entry objects. Atomic writes via temp-file + rename. The archive (entries the audit cycle has retired) lives in a parallel `backend/archived_store.json`.

**Entry shape:**

```jsonc
{
  "event_id":         "uuid-v4",
  "trace_id":         "uuid-v4 from ingest event",
  "course":           "FE102",
  "week":             "2",
  "lesson":           "Composing components",
  "raw_text":         "the original lesson text the user pasted in",
  "summary":          "4-8 sentence prose explanation",
  "key_concepts":     ["array of strings"],
  "definitions":      ["array of 'term — explanation' strings"],
  "code_blocks":      ["array of verbatim code blocks from the source"],
  "validation_score": 1.0,
  "created_at":       "ISO-8601 UTC",

  // Only present on audit-generated versions:
  "version":          2,
  "audit_generated":  true
}
```

**Key invariants:**

- Entries are grouped by `(course, week, lesson)`. Re-ingesting a lesson with the same key **replaces** the canonical entry rather than appending a duplicate. See `core/memory_writer_node.py`.
- A single lesson group can have **multiple active versions** — the original user-ingested entry plus zero or more audit-generated alternatives.
- The **oldest** active entry in a group is **canonical** — what every downstream consumer (graph, list, advisor, quiz, vault, classroom) reads. See `core/sot_groups.py::canonical_entries`.
- Newer versions exist in the background as alternatives. They become canonical only when an older version is archived by the audit loop.
- The audit loop maintains 2-3 active versions per lesson, archiving the weakest when a group is unambiguously stable. See [the audit loop section](#the-self-improving-audit-loop).

---

## The five-stage ingestion pipeline

When a lesson is pasted into the Ingest modal, it travels a fixed five-stage pipeline before joining the SOT. Each stage produces a typed event the next consumes. The pipeline streams its events back to the browser as NDJSON, so the user watches each stage light up live.

```
   ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
   │ graph_entry  │─►│  retrieval   │─►│summarization │─►│  validation  │─►│ memory_write │
   │              │  │              │  │              │  │              │  │              │
   │ trace_id +   │  │ (currently   │  │ llama3:8b    │  │ pure-Python  │  │ atomic JSON  │
   │ timestamp    │  │  pass-thru)  │  │ JSON output  │  │ rule checks  │  │ + vault sync │
   └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

**graph_entry** (`core/graph_entry_node.py`): emits a `pipeline_event` with the trace ID and timestamp. Cheap. No LLM.

**retrieval** (`core/retrieval_node.py`): currently a pass-through that forwards the raw_text. Kept as a stage so future context-aware ingestion (e.g., conditioning summarization on related SOT entries) has a place to live.

**summarization** (`agents/summarization_agent.py`): the LLM-heavy stage. Calls `llama3:8b` with a tight prompt and parses the structured JSON response. The agent layers multiple defenses against captured failure modes — JSON repair for truncated output, prose-wrapper stripping, nested-summary unwrapping, regex-fallback field extraction, chunking for long lessons. Most of these defenses exist because the LLM produced specific malformed outputs in the wild and the agent now handles them. See the file's top-of-file docstring for the full defense list.

**validation** (`agents/validation_agent.py`): pure-Python gate. The single most important stage for correctness. See [the Deterministic Scaffold section](#the-deterministic-scaffold) for the full rule list. Failures don't write.

**memory_write** (`core/memory_writer_node.py`): only runs if validation passed. Upserts by `(course, week, lesson)`, writes atomically through a temp file, then mirrors the SOT into the Obsidian vault as markdown (see `core/obsidian_export.py`). Vault sync failures don't fail the ingest — the SOT is canonical, the vault is a derived view.

**Streaming surface:** the pipeline runs inside `core/ingestion_pipeline.py`. Each stage produces events that get serialized to NDJSON and streamed back to the browser. The frontend's `DataFlowCanvas.jsx` animates the data flow in real time, lighting up nodes as their stage's events arrive.

---

## The advisor pipeline

User-facing chat over the SOT is its own pipeline (`core/advisor_pipeline.py`), architecturally parallel to ingestion. Same streaming-NDJSON shape, same event vocabulary, same one-action-per-stage discipline.

```
   ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
   │  retrieval   │─►│     arc      │─►│  section ×N  │─►│    recap     │─►│   assembly   │
   │              │  │              │  │              │  │              │  │              │
   │ sot_selector │  │  llama3.1:8b │  │  llama3.1:8b │  │  llama3.1:8b │  │ deterministic│
   │              │  │  (one para)  │  │  (per entry) │  │  (one para)  │  │ terminal     │
   └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

**retrieval** (`core/sot_selector.py`): picks relevant canonical SOT entries via course/week-aware filtering plus keyword-overlap scoring. Returns canonicals only — audit-generated satellites are filtered out at the `_load_sot` boundary so the advisor never weighs duplicate versions of the same lesson.

**arc** (`agents/advisor_agent.py::stream_reduce` with `mode="arc"`): one focused LLM call that reads the matched lesson list (just titles + first-sentence summaries) and writes a 2-4 sentence opening paragraph naming the conceptual journey across the lessons. Skipped for single-entry queries — there's no arc to narrate across one lesson. The arc reduce intentionally does NOT see the per-section output; it works only from the lesson list, which keeps it fast (~5-10s) and isolates its failure mode (a bad arc never affects section quality).

**section ×N** (`agents/advisor_agent.py::stream_section`): the map step. One LLM call per retrieved entry. Each call receives ONE SOT entry's full content plus the user's question, and produces a single study-guide section (markdown header, key concepts, definitions, code samples, brief overview). Sections run sequentially because Ollama serves one request per model at a time on a single GPU — parallelism would just queue.

**recap** (`agents/advisor_agent.py::stream_reduce` with `mode="recap"`): mirror of the arc at the other end. Same input shape (lesson list + summaries, not section content), same isolation properties. Writes a 2-3 sentence closing paragraph naming what the user should now understand.

**assembly**: deterministic terminal marker. The assembled output IS the concatenated token stream the client has already received in order — Python does the concatenation implicitly via the streaming event order. No second LLM call here.

### Why this architecture instead of a single LLM call

The previous design fed all N retrieved entries to a single LLM call with one fixed output budget. Three problems followed:

1. **Code samples got compressed away.** With a fixed output budget split across 9 lessons, the model would summarize the prose and drop the code (heavy in tokens, easy to cut).
2. **Per-lesson grounding occasionally drifted.** Skim-reading 9 entries at once produced inversion errors — e.g., the model once flipped the "use stable id, not array index" lesson into its opposite.
3. **Output structure was uneven.** Some lessons got dense treatment, others got two-bullet stubs, depending on what the model decided to compress.

The per-section pipeline fixes all three: each lesson gets a dedicated output budget; each section's prompt sees only that one lesson, so grounding errors stay localized; and the structure is consistent across runs because every section runs the same template.

### Why deterministic assembly instead of an LLM reduce

The assembly stage is pure Python — string concatenation of the already-streamed tokens in arrival order. An LLM reduce would be a second model call that could hallucinate cross-lesson claims it never saw evidence for. Aligns with the project's "model proposes, Python disposes" rule (see [The Deterministic Scaffold](#the-deterministic-scaffold) below).

The arc and recap ARE LLM calls — but they're scoped reduces, narrowly focused on framing-paragraph generation from a known input (the lesson list). They never modify, edit, or comment on the sections themselves.

### Event shapes

Both pipelines share the same event vocabulary:

```
{"type": "start",         "query": "..."}                       # advisor
{"type": "start",         "event": {...}}                       # ingest
{"type": "step_start",    "step": "<stage_name>", ...}
{"type": "step_complete", "step": "<stage_name>", ...}
{"type": "token",         "value": "...", "section_id": "..."}  (many — advisor)
{"type": "done"}
{"type": "error",         "message": "..."}
```

The frontend's `ChatPanel.jsx` (for advisor) and `DataFlowCanvas.jsx` (for ingest) consume this identical event vocabulary differently — ChatPanel maintains a live staging strip ("section 3 of 9 · Conditional rendering") plus accumulates token events into a markdown-rendered response body; DataFlowCanvas lights up pipeline nodes as their step_complete events arrive.

---

## The Classroom flow

Where the curation chain ends. The Classroom takes one saved artifact (a Notebook section, or — via the secondary path — a SOT entry directly), turns it into a beat-by-beat teaching plan, and plays the plan back with real-time CHECK grading and mid-session Q&A.

```

```

**Picker — Notebook-listening as primary**

Default entry: `core/notebook_store.list_teachable_sections()` returns every saved section across every saved note, with grounding ratios attached. The UI groups them under collapsible note headers. Per-section action is **🎓 Teach** (fresh — triggers a new plan generation) or **▶ Resume** (cached — loads a previously-generated plan instantly, no LLM call).

The secondary "Browse all lessons →" path falls back to the legacy `LessonPicker` over the full SOT, for the one-off "teach me this lesson I haven't saved yet" case.

**Plan generation — two entry endpoints, one downstream pipeline**

- `POST /api/classroom/plan` — generates from a SOT `event_id`. Legacy/SOT-direct path.
- `POST /api/classroom/plan-from-section` — generates from a Notebook `(notebook_id, section_index)`. Newer Notebook-derived path. The notebook section's content gets wrapped as the synthetic input to the Teacher Aide.

Both endpoints stream the same NDJSON event shape (`start`, `model_start`, `progress`, `beat`, `done`, `error`), so `ClassroomPanel.jsx` consumes them identically. Both go through `validate_plan(plan, source_text=...)` — structural validation (hard-fail) + grounding gate (soft warning + report attached).

**Beat playback**

`ClassroomPanel.PlayingView` walks through `plan.beats[]` sequentially. Each beat type renders differently in `BeatRenderer.jsx`:

| Beat type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| INTRO | Typewriter-style header, then advance |
| EXPOSITION | Typewriter prose, then advance |
| EXAMPLE | Prose + syntax-highlighted code block (via the shared `CodeBlock` primitive) + explanation |
| CHECK | Multiple choice. Question types in; the 4 options render as a radio-button grid, shuffled on mount via a stable display→canonical index map. The student picks an option; the backend compares its canonical index to the plan's `correct_index` (deterministic, no LLM call). The correct option flashes ✓ green, picked-wrong gets ✗ yellow, the static `explanation` field reveals below. |
| RECAP | Muted typewriter prose |
| TRANSITION | Brief connector text |

CHECK answers persist in the session's `events` log as `check_answered` events carrying `selected_index`, `correct_index`, `passed`, `score` (deterministic 0 or 100), and a `first_try` flag — the rails for a per-lesson gradebook that aggregates these into mastery state. Typed-answer recall lives in the separate Quiz surface, which keeps the LLM grader (mistral) since open-ended answers can't be index-compared.

**Raise-hand Q&A — Teacher v2**

At any beat, the student can click **🙋 Raise hand** to ask a question. `POST /api/classroom/session/raise-hand` resolves the plan's source material (Notebook section content if notebook-derived, SOT entry's `raw_text` if SOT-derived), streams the Teacher's answer via `stream_question_answer`, and runs `combined_report` on the assembled answer against that source. The grounding ratio surfaces as a chip on the answer; the question + answer + grounding report all append to the session record.

Important: the current beat is **not advanced** by the Q&A. After the student clicks "← Continue lesson," they return to the same beat. The session timeline shows the Q&A as a sidebar event, not a beat substitution.

Trust contract preserved: the Teacher's runtime output goes through the same Python grounding gate the plan-generation output does. Verification stays continuous through the entire session, not just at plan-creation time.

**Session persistence**

Sessions are saved as JSON files under `backend/classroom/sessions/`, one file per session. Each session carries:

- `plan_id` and `lesson_event_id` references
- `current_beat` index for resumption
- `events[]` log of everything that happened: `beat_completed`, `check_answered` (with `selected_index` / `correct_index` / `first_try`), `raise_hand_question`, `raise_hand_answer`
- `summary_stats` for the recap card (CHECK count, pass rate, average score)

Atomic temp-file-and-rename writes, same pattern as the SOT and notebook stores. A crash mid-session leaves the most recently persisted state intact.

**Three pipelines, one event vocabulary**

The Classroom flow is the third major streaming pipeline in the system, alongside the ingest pipeline and the advisor pipeline. All three emit the same NDJSON event grammar: `step_start` / `step_complete` / `token` / `done` / `error`. All three are observed by the same kind of UI layer (a live progress indicator + a streamed body). The pattern is now used three times deliberately — that's "compound AI systems" executed as a system-wide convention, not a one-off scaffolding for ingest.

---

## The Gradebook layer

Downstream of both Classroom CHECKs and Quiz attempts. A single append-only event log + a pure-Python aggregation module turn the raw per-answer signal into per-lesson grades, mastery flags, and Quiz-as-extra-credit blending. No LLM, no UI yet — the visible gradebook tab is the next planned surface.

### The store (`core/gradebook_store.py`)

One JSON file at `backend/gradebook.json`, atomic temp+rename writes, threading lock against concurrent appends. Same persistence discipline as `classroom_store` and `notebook_store`.

Records share lesson identity (`course` / `week` / `lesson` / `lesson_event_id`) and a `ts`, but otherwise diverge by type:

```jsonc
// classroom_check — every MC answer in a Classroom session
{
  "type": "classroom_check",
  "ts": "2026-05-27T...",
  "session_id": "...", "plan_id": "...", "lesson_event_id": "...",
  "course": "...", "week": "...", "lesson": "...",
  "beat_id": "...",
  "selected_index": 2,   // canonical (against plan order, not shuffled display)
  "correct_index": 0,
  "passed": false, "score": 0,
  "first_try": true      // mastery signal — first attempt at this beat in this session
}

// quiz_attempt — one graded Quiz question
{
  "type": "quiz_attempt",
  "ts": "...",
  "lesson_event_id": "...", "course": "...", "week": "...", "lesson": "...",
  "question": "...",
  "score": 75,           // 0-100 from mistral
  "model": "mistral"
}
```

Records are appended immediately after their source event has been persisted upstream (session log for CHECKs, quiz grade response for attempts). Writes are wrapped in `try/except` at the controller — gradebook write failures are logged but never fail the student's CHECK submit or quiz grade response. Losing one record is acceptable; surfacing an internal-storage error to the student mid-lesson is not.

### The grading math (`core/grading.py`)

Pure functions, no I/O. `aggregate_lesson(records, lesson_event_id)` and `aggregate_all_lessons(records)` consume raw records and return per-lesson aggregates with this shape:

```jsonc
{
  "lesson_event_id": "...",
  "course": "...", "week": "...", "lesson": "...",
  "classroom_attempts": int,         // total check_answered ever
  "classroom_sessions": int,         // distinct session_ids touched
  "best_session": {                  // the highest-scoring session
    "score": float,                  // first_try_correct / total × 100
    "first_try_correct": int,
    "total": int,
    "session_id": str
  },
  "mastery": bool,                   // exists a session with all-first-try passes
                                     // and ≥ MASTERY_MIN_CHECKS (2) CHECKs
  "quiz_attempts": int,
  "best_quiz_score": int | None,     // max across all attempts
  "quiz_bonus": float,               // best_quiz × QUIZ_BONUS_MAX_PCT / 100
  "final_grade": float,              // min(100, best_session.score + quiz_bonus)
  "last_attempt_at": str | None
}
```

The rules in one sentence each:

- **Lesson base score = best session score.** Group CHECKs by session_id, compute `first_try_correct / total_in_session` per session, take the max. Successful retake rewards you; bad retake doesn't punish you. Matches the "best attempt counts" principle.
- **Mastery = there exists a session where every first-try CHECK passed AND ≥ MASTERY_MIN_CHECKS (default 2) CHECKs were answered.** Single-CHECK fluke can't grant mastery.
- **Quiz extra credit = `best_quiz_score × QUIZ_BONUS_MAX_PCT / 100`.** Linear scale (a quiz of 50 gives half the max bonus, not zero). Capped at +20% by default.
- **Final grade = `min(100, lesson_base + quiz_bonus)`.** Bonus can lift a poor Classroom grade meaningfully but can never push past 100.

No tier names (bronze/silver/gold) baked into the math — those are UI-layer mappings from the numeric grade + mastery boolean, left to whatever the gradebook UI eventually decides to render.

### What the layer is NOT

- **No UI yet.** The data accumulates silently. Phase 4 of the gradebook arc adds the visible Gradebook tab, mastery chips in the Notebook + SOT pickers, and the home-page widget.
- **No averaging across lessons.** There's no overall GPA concept here; that's a UI-layer rollup.
- **No persistence of user-typed quiz answers.** The record holds the score + question text, not the user's answer text. Trade-off for record size; if "let me see what I typed" becomes a felt need we can revisit.

## The mobile experience

The whole app reflows for phones via a single `useIsMobile()` hook (`frontend/src/lib/useMediaQuery.js`, breakpoint 768px). Mobile is treated as its own product context — *grab-and-glance, snacking format* — not as "the desktop UI, smaller."

### The five mobile-only design decisions

1. **Header collapses to a 56px compact bar.** No big brand block, no "SOURCES OF TRUTH" wordmark row. Just the wordmark + a dropdown picker for the six views. The dropdown's labels match the desktop nav order so muscle memory transfers; "Graph" renames to "Home" because the mobile rendering of that view is the dedicated home screen (chips over an ambient graph), not the interactive graph the desktop label implies.

2. **Modals go full-bleed.** The desktop modal's 60+40px padding eats half a phone screen; mobile modals fill the screen with no border, no rounded corners, no glow. Same content, different chrome.

3. **Master-detail surfaces collapse.** The Notebook (sidebar list + detail) and Classroom in-session view (`LessonPlanSidebar` + `BeatRenderer`) both flip from desktop two-pane layouts to single-pane mobile layouts. The list/sidebar collapses into a top-of-screen dropdown picker that summons the list on tap and dismisses when a row is selected — same idiom used for both. Most recent note auto-selects on mount so the user lands on content, not an empty "pick something" state.

4. **Dedicated mobile home screen.** `MobileHomePanel` renders the GraphPanel in ambient mode (no interaction, slowed pulse) as the background, dimmed to 55% with a radial vignette for chip legibility, and overlays action chips: `⚡ Quick Quiz`, `🎓 Teach me something`, `📓 Browse Notebook`, `📚 Browse all lessons`. Footer shows last-opened lesson + streak count. The whole surface is built for the "I just reached for my phone, suggest something to do" moment.

5. **The ✦ Pulse button.** Top-right of the graph area, ~48px circular, with a 3-second breathing animation (scale + opacity + glow) that runs continuously to advertise interactivity. Tap fires one heartbeat wave across the graph; button enters a 3-second "spent" state during the wave so over-tapping doesn't queue overlapping pulses. The breathing animation is pure CSS (GPU-accelerated, essentially free thermally). Auto-pulses still fire in ambient mode but at 120s intervals (vs the desktop's 3.7s "tide") so the home screen stays cool while still catching the occasional surprise wave.

### Ambient-mode graph

`GraphPanel` accepts an `ambient` prop that:

- Disables pointer interaction at both the wrapper (`pointerEvents: none` so taps fall through to overlaid UI) and the library (`enableNodeDrag={false}`, `enablePointerInteraction={false}`)
- Hides the Legend, SettingsPanel, and HoverRipple (chrome that would compete with chips for attention)
- Drops the heartbeat interval to 120000ms (from 3700ms on desktop)
- Accepts a `pulseSignal` counter that, when incremented, fires one on-demand heartbeat wave — this is the wire from the ✦ button to the graph
- Takes a `headerOffset` prop so the canvas sizes correctly under the 56px mobile header instead of the 160px desktop one

One thing the ambient mode does NOT do: settle the d3 simulation after warmup. An earlier optimization attempted this (set `cooldownTicks` finite) but broke the pulse render loop — react-force-graph's render cycle is tied to d3 ticks, so when alpha decays to zero the library stops calling the render callbacks and queued pulses never draw. The current implementation accepts continuous d3 ticking as the cost of working pulses; the 16× pulse-frequency reduction (3.7s → 120s) is doing most of the heat-reduction work anyway.

### PWA install

`frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest` + brand-mark icons (192, 512 for Chrome PWA; 180 for iOS apple-touch-icon; 32 + 16 for legacy favicons) make the app installable from Chrome's "Install app" or Safari's "Add to Home Screen." Standalone display mode means the home-screen icon launches into a full-screen app without browser chrome. Theme color, background color, status-bar styling all match the system dark palette.

Icons are generated by `frontend/scripts/generate-pwa-icons.py` from the same brand mark the in-app `Logo` component renders — concentric green rings + bright accent core + subtle halo on dark navy. One script means all sizes stay in lockstep; re-run when the brand mark changes.

### What the mobile build is NOT

- **Not feature parity with desktop.** Ingest is desktop-only (paste-a-long-lesson-into-a-textarea is a desktop activity). Interactive Graph manipulation is desktop-only (force-graph + touch + small screen is a poor experience). These are deliberate omissions, not gaps.
- **Not service-worker backed.** The app needs the Mac on and the backend reachable; nothing works offline. Adding a service worker for offline reads is a possible v2 but adds complexity not justified for a personal tool.
- **Not exhaustively polished.** The structural responsive pass (M2) made every panel reflow correctly but only the most-used surfaces (Notebook, Classroom, mobile home) got detailed touch-target / sizing tuning. Other panels (Chat, About, Archives, List, the picker variants) work but may have rough edges; surgical fixes happen as real-device testing surfaces them.

## Agent roster

Eleven named agents. Each does exactly one thing.

| Agent | Role | File | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Summarization | Extract structure from raw lesson text | `agents/summarization_agent.py` | `llama3:8b` |
| Validation | Pre-write gate | `agents/validation_agent.py` | pure Python |
| Audit | Background self-improvement loop | `agents/audit_agent.py` | orchestrator (pure Python) |
| Judge | Score audit-generated alternatives | `agents/judge_agent.py` | pure Python (deterministic) |
| Advisor | SOT-grounded natural-language chat (per-section pipeline) | `agents/advisor_agent.py` + `core/advisor_pipeline.py` | `llama3.1:8b` |
| Quiz Generator | Recall questions from a lesson | `agents/quiz_agent.py::generate_question` | `llama3.2` |
| Quiz Grader | Score student answers (judge-separated) | `agents/quiz_agent.py::grade_answer` | `mistral` |
| General Chat | Untethered conversation, no SOT grounding | `agents/general_chat_agent.py` | `llama3.2` |
| Teacher Aide | Generate classroom lesson plans | `agents/teacher_aide_agent.py` | `llama3.2` |
| Teacher | Runtime classroom interactions: raise-hand Q&A (CHECK grading is now deterministic; no LLM correction needed) | `agents/teacher_agent.py` | `llama3.2` |
| Memory Writer | Atomic SOT/archive persistence + vault sync | `core/memory_writer_node.py` | pure Python (file I/O) |

**Routing.** All model assignments live in one file: `backend/core/model_router.py`. Changing any agent's model is a single-line edit there; agents import the role they need (`SUMMARIZE`, `ADVISE`, etc.) and never hardcode model names.

---

## The Deterministic Scaffold

The system's central design principle: **the LLM is one component, surrounded by deterministic Python fences.**

Four of the eleven agents above don't run an LLM at all. Neither does the orchestrator that runs them. Together they form the scaffold:

### 1. Validation (the write-time gate)

`backend/agents/validation_agent.py`. A pure-Python function that decides whether a summarization output is allowed to persist as a SOT entry. Rule checks, in order:

- **Structural shape.** Required fields present, summarization dict not null.
- **Not raw JSON.** Catches the LLM-fallback failure mode where a malformed model output dumps its raw JSON into the `summary` field instead of producing prose.
- **Key concepts required on non-trivial lessons.** A lesson ≥200 characters that produced zero key concepts didn't really get extracted.
- **Substantive summary length.** Catches the title-only-as-summary regression.
- **Per-item grounding gate.** The strongest defense. Each `key_concept` and `definition` is checked against the raw lesson text:
  - STRICT match: the item appears as a substring (case-insensitive) in the raw text. Kept.
  - LOOSE match: at least one token (≥4 chars) of the item appears in the raw text. Kept.
  - DROPPED: neither holds — the item is hallucinated. Removed from the entry before write.
- **Hard fail on >60% ungrounded.** If more than 60% of extracted items get dropped by the grounding gate, the whole entry is rejected. The model is fabricating more than half the extraction; nothing left is trustworthy.

Failures don't write. Drops are surfaced to the user as warnings.

### 2. The Judge (the audit-time scorer)

`backend/agents/judge_agent.py`. A pure-Python function that ranks alternative versions of the same lesson. See [the scoring formula section](#the-judges-scoring-formula).

The Judge was originally an LLM (`mistral`). In practice, mistral returned 10/10 for nearly every summary regardless of measurable quality differences, defeating the entire audit cycle. The pure-Python rewrite picks a winner every time with no model drift, no Ollama call, no judgment-day variance.

### 3. The Orchestrator (the pipeline + audit loop)

`backend/core/ingestion_pipeline.py` runs the five-stage pipeline as a fixed sequence with typed event handoffs. Each stage produces an event the next consumes. If validation fails, memory_write never runs. If summarization throws, the pipeline halts and the error is preserved for the user to see. There is no "agent loop" choosing what to do next — the control flow is a switch statement.

`backend/agents/audit_agent.py::run_one_step` is the same shape: pick the next lesson, route to score-and-archive vs. create-new-version, suppress churning lessons, skip stable groups. The decisions are control flow; the LLM is summoned only when it has something useful to do.

### 4. Memory Writer (the persistence gate)

`backend/core/memory_writer_node.py`. The gate to the file system itself.

- **Atomic writes.** Temp file + rename, so a crash mid-write can't corrupt the SOT.
- **Upsert by `(course, week, lesson)`.** Re-ingesting cleans up rather than duplicating.
- **Obsidian sync as side effect after successful commit.** Never before, never instead. The SOT is canonical; the vault is derived. Vault failures don't fail the ingest.

### The principle

A well-fenced LLM inside a deterministic scaffold becomes reliable as a system, because the unreliable component is wrapped in reliable ones that decide whether to trust each output, when to retry, when to skip, when to score, when to commit.

In the broader field this goes by names like *guardrails*, *compound AI systems* (Zaharia et al., Berkeley AI Research, 2024), or *constrained generation*. It's well-known in production-LLM engineering circles; less prominent in popular AI discourse.

---

## The self-improving audit loop

`backend/agents/audit_agent.py`. A background asyncio task that fires every `AUDIT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 15 minutes).

Each tick executes exactly **one action**:

```
                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                  │                       run_one_step()                        │
                  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                                │
                                                ▼
                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                  │  Walk 3-node groups, oldest-first                           │
                  │  ├─ If group is churn-suppressed → leave alone, next group  │
                  │  ├─ Score with Judge                                        │
                  │  │   ├─ bottom-two gap < 5.0  → "stable", next group        │
                  │  │   └─ bottom-two gap ≥ 5.0  → archive lowest, RETURN      │
                  │  └─ (all 3-node groups walked)                              │
                  │                                                             │
                  │  Walk 2-node groups, expanding the most-stale               │
                  │  ├─ If lesson is churn-suppressed → skip                    │
                  │  └─ Else → create a new version via summarization, RETURN   │
                  │                                                             │
                  │  If nothing was actionable → noop                           │
                  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Two guards** prevent the audit from churning unproductively:

### Stable-group guard

If the bottom-two scores in a 3-node group are within `SCORE_GAP_EPSILON = 5.0` points of each other, the audit recognizes the model has converged on this lesson and **leaves the group alone**. No archive, no re-roll. The next tick tries a different group.

Without this guard, the audit would archive whichever version it generated most recently (the tiebreak is "newest first"), then the next tick would generate a new near-identical version, archive that one too — wasting llama3:8b compute indefinitely on a lesson that can't be improved.

### Churn suppression

If a lesson has been archived more than `CHURN_MAX_ARCHIVES = 2` times in the last `CHURN_WINDOW_HOURS = 24` hours, the audit suppresses it entirely. Neither score-and-archive nor create-new-version touches it until the window slides forward.

Both guards apply to both audit actions (score-and-archive and create-new-version), so churning lessons drop out of the audit's attention immediately rather than getting one more cycle of waste.

### Why the audit doesn't break canonical reads

The canonical entry for any lesson is the **oldest** active entry. Audit-generated versions are appended to the SOT array but are not canonical until the older entry is archived. Downstream consumers (graph, list, advisor, quiz, vault, classroom) all use `core/sot_groups.py::canonical_entries` which picks one entry per lesson group. So even when a group temporarily sits at 3 active versions, every downstream view sees exactly one.

---

## The Judge's scoring formula

`backend/agents/judge_agent.py::score_entry`. Pure deterministic, no LLM, no I/O.

```
score = grounded_kc   × 5   −  ungrounded_kc   × 2
      + grounded_defs × 3   −  ungrounded_defs × 1
      + code_blocks   × 2
      + min(summary_len, 800) × 0.05
```

**Grounding** is the same substring + token check the Validation gate uses. A key concept (or definition's term half) is *grounded* if it appears in the raw lesson text; *ungrounded* otherwise.

**Notes on the formula:**

- **Grounded items add; ungrounded items subtract.** This is the system's opinion about hallucination encoded in math. A summary that pads with concepts the lesson never mentions can't beat one that stays anchored.
- **Code blocks are unsigned** (+2 each) because they're either copied verbatim from the source or not — there's no "hallucinated code" failure mode the way there is for concepts and definitions.
- **Summary length has diminishing returns** and caps at 800 characters. Long doesn't beat dense.
- **Same inputs always produce the same score.** Auditable, reproducible, no model drift across time.
- **Free.** No Ollama call, no GPU time.

The formula's tuning was empirical — values were calibrated against observed audit-loop behavior on real data, not derived from theory.

## The graph visualization

`frontend/src/components/GraphPanel.jsx` (~2000 lines). The most architecturally involved component in the frontend.

Built on [`react-force-graph-2d`](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph). The graph view is *not* a passive visualization — it's a real-time animated representation of the SOT.

### Force layers (per d3-force tick)

Six forces, layered:

1. **`charge`** — nodes repel each other. Default `-600`, user-tunable.
2. **`link`** — connected nodes attract. Three link types: hub-spokes (every SOT node to the central Chat hub), concept links (between SOT nodes that share key concepts), audit tethers (a faint dashed line from each canonical entry to its audit-generated satellites).
3. **`center`** — weak pull toward origin (d3 default).
4. **`orbital`** — tangential velocity per non-hub node, producing circular drift around the hub.
5. **`hubExclusion`** — radial inward floor. No node may sit closer than `HUB_EXCLUSION = 250` to origin. Nodes that penetrate get pushed radially outward.
6. **`outerBoundary`** — radial outward ceiling. No canonical SOT node may sit further than `BOUNDARY_RADIUS = 500` from origin. Nodes that overshoot get pushed radially inward. Together with `hubExclusion`, these soft elastic walls give the layout a disc shape.
7. **`symmetry`** — pulls each course's nodes toward its angular slot on a ring around origin, producing a flower-like radial layout rather than a sprawling blob. With "aliveness" on, the whole formation drifts via a slow Lissajous wander.

### Heartbeat pulse system

Every `HEARTBEAT_MS = 3700` ms, the hub fires a fresh wave of pulses. Each pulse is a three-hop cascade:

- **Depth 0** (1400ms): hub → SOT. White comet riding the hub-spoke.
- **Depth 1** (900ms): SOT → up-to-2 random concept-link neighbors. Course-colored gradient comets riding the concept-link edges.
- **Depth 2** (1400ms): neighbor → hub. Course-color-to-white gradient comets riding home.

Total per-cycle: 3700ms. The heartbeat interval is set exactly to the cycle length so the next outbound wave launches the same frame the previous wave's return leg lands — zero overlap, continuous tide.

The pulse position uses **linear easing** within each leg, so the comet maintains constant velocity through handoffs rather than decelerating at each node. This eliminates the "rest" feel of eased-out-then-eased-in handoffs.

### Audit satellites

Audit-generated versions of a canonical lesson render as smaller, dim orbs tethered to the canonical by a faint dashed link. They orbit the canonical (not the hub) and follow it around as it drifts. The `hubExclusion` and `outerBoundary` forces skip them so they can ride slightly past the boundary if their canonical sits near the edge.

## Write protection and tunnel sharing

The project supports a "share with friends" posture via Tailscale Funnel.

**Local-only mode.** With `MYAISTRO_WRITE_PASSWORD` unset, all endpoints are unrestricted. This is the default dev mode.

**Owner-write mode.** With `MYAISTRO_WRITE_PASSWORD=<secret>` set, mutating endpoints require an `X-Write-Password` header whose value matches via constant-time comparison (`core/auth.py`):

| Endpoint | Mode | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/sot/graph`, `/api/sot/list`, `/api/sot/archives`, `/api/stats` | read | open |
| `/api/advisor/chat`, `/api/chat/general`, `/api/quiz/question`, `/api/quiz/grade`, `/api/quiz/random` | read/inference | open |
| `/api/classroom/guest/plan` | ephemeral plan generation for tunnel visitors | open |
| `/api/ingest`, `/api/sot/resummarize`, `/api/sot/sync-obsidian`, `/api/audit/run-once` | mutate | **write-password required** |
| `/api/classroom/*` (non-guest) | mutate / persistent | **write-password required** |

The owner unlocks once via the UI; the password persists in browser `localStorage` and is attached to every mutating request via `frontend/src/lib/writeAuth.js::writeFetch`.

**Guest Classroom.** Visitors who land on the Tailscale Funnel URL get an ephemeral Classroom mode — they can take guest sessions, but nothing they do persists, and their sessions never touch the audit history or affect future learning signal. CHECK grading happens entirely client-side for guests (the MC `selected_index` vs `correct_index` compare is a single line of JS), so there's no per-answer server round-trip — the only guest endpoint is `POST /api/classroom/guest/plan` for ephemeral plan generation. See `backend/api/classroom_guest_controller.py`.

## Data persistence

| File | Purpose | Tracked? |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/memory_store.json` | The SOT — all active lesson entries | gitignored |
| `backend/archived_store.json` | Entries the audit cycle has retired | gitignored |
| `backend/visits.json` | Local visit counter | gitignored |
| `backend/gradebook.json` | Per-CHECK + per-quiz-attempt event log (Phase 2-3) | gitignored |
| `backend/classroom/plans/*.json` | Persisted classroom lesson plans (one per plan) | gitignored |
| `backend/classroom/sessions/*.json` | Persisted classroom session records | gitignored |
| `~/Documents/myAIstro-vault/**/*.md` | Obsidian-style markdown mirror | external to repo |
| `backend/.env` | Optional secrets (e.g., `MYAISTRO_WRITE_PASSWORD`) | gitignored |

All writes go through atomic temp-file-and-rename. No partial writes can corrupt the SOT.

## Performance characteristics

Measured on M4 Pro / 24GB RAM. Numbers are rough.

| Operation | Latency | Bottleneck |
|---|---|---|
| Load `/api/sot/graph` (~200 lessons) | <100ms | JSON parse + concept-link computation |
| Ingest a typical lesson | 15-30 s | llama3:8b summarization |
| Advisor query (single SOT entry) | ~20 s for full section | llama3.1:8b generation |
| Advisor query (9 entries — e.g. course-week study guide) | ~3-4 min total: ~6s arc + ~20s × 9 sections + ~6s recap | sequential LLM calls (Ollama serves one per model at a time) |
| Quiz grading | 3-8 s | mistral grading call |
| Manual audit step (`/api/audit/run-once`) | 0.1-30 s | depends on action: score-and-archive is <1s, create-new-version is 15-30s |
| Background audit cycle | one action per 15 min | rate-limited intentionally |

**Memory.** llama3:8b uses ~5-6GB resident in VRAM. llama3.1:8b similar (~5GB). llama3.2 (3B variant) uses ~2-3GB. mistral uses ~4GB. Ollama will evict idle models to serve another, so the first call after switching roles may incur a model-load cost of 2-5 seconds. The advisor pipeline keeps llama3.1:8b hot across its arc/section/recap calls (all the same model), so within a single advisor query there's no swap cost between stages.

**Scale ceiling.** The SOT is loaded into memory on every API call. With ~200 lessons (~6MB JSON file), this is sub-100ms. Past a few thousand lessons, the design would want to either keep the SOT cached in memory across requests or move to a real database. Not a priority for a personal-tool use case.

---

## Known limitations and future direction

**Things this codebase deliberately doesn't do:**

- No user accounts. Single-tenant.
- No telemetry. Local visitor counter only.
- No external LLM APIs.
- No subscription, no quota tracking.
- No social/collaboration features.

**Architecture is preparing for** (not yet implemented):

- **Span citations.** Advisor / Quiz Grader / Teacher could return structured `{answer, citations: [{event_id, span}]}` with each cited span substring-verified against the raw lesson. The grounding rules already enforce that the model can only reference material it can point at; the next step is making those pointers explicit in the UI. Touches `agents/advisor_agent.py`, `agents/quiz_agent.py::grade_answer`, `agents/teacher_agent.py::stream_question_answer` (raise-hand), plus rendering in `ChatPanel.jsx` and `classroom/BeatRenderer.jsx`.
- **Gradebook UI (Phase 4 of the gradebook arc).** The data layer is live and records accumulate on every Classroom CHECK + Quiz attempt. The visible surface is the natural next step — a transcript view with per-course rollups, mastery chips on every lesson row in the Notebook + SOT pickers, and a home-screen widget showing overall grade. Designed responsive-first so it works on the mobile home from day one.
- **Spaced-repetition surfacing.** Once the gradebook UI exists, the home (especially mobile) can surface "lessons you haven't touched in 7+ days" or "concepts you've struggled with (low first-try rate)" as additional action chips. Pulls from the gradebook's `last_attempt_at` + per-lesson aggregate data already produced by `core/grading.py`.
- **Pre-recorded ambient graph loop.** The current mobile ambient graph keeps d3 ticking continuously to keep the pulse render loop alive — acceptable but not ideal thermally. A pre-recorded WebM of one heartbeat cycle, played as a looping `<video>` with hardware decode, would drop home-screen CPU to near zero. Trade-off is a stale snapshot of the SOT (the loop is "your graph as of date X"), so the option is staged behind a real felt need for additional cooling, not pre-emptively swapped.
- **Embedding-based paraphrase grounding.** The current grounding check is substring + token-match. Adding an embedding pass (via `nomic-embed-text` through Ollama) would catch paraphrase grounding that the substring check misses. Optional polish.
- **Spaced-repetition surfacing.** The audit produces a deterministic richness score per version; classroom sessions record which CHECK beats a student got wrong. Combining those signals could schedule specific lessons for re-study at the right intervals.
- **Cross-lesson synthesis in Classroom.** The Teacher Aide currently builds plans from one SOT entry. Letting it pull from multiple related entries unlocks real curriculum-style teaching.

**Known sharp edges:**

- Re-ingesting an already-canonical lesson resets that lesson's audit history (the new entry has no `audit_generated` flag, so it becomes the new canonical and the previous audit-generated alternatives stay as siblings until the audit loop walks them).
- The `aliveness` toggle in the Graph view applies a slow Lissajous wander to the whole formation. With many nodes near the outer boundary at peak wander, nodes on the wander-leading edge can briefly pile against the boundary wall. Not currently a problem at ~200 nodes; could become visually noticeable at higher counts.
- Classroom plans depend on `llama3.2` producing valid JSON. The plan validator (`agents/plan_validator.py`) and per-beat salvager in `teacher_aide_agent.py::_salvage_beats` handle most malformed outputs, but extreme JSON corruption may still produce plans with fewer beats than the prompt requested.
- MC distractor quality is a model-quality question, not an architectural one. The validator catches the recurring llama3.2 failure modes (label-prefixed options, question-shaped options, duplicate options, forbidden non-answers) and the controller auto-retries on validation failure, but the prompt continues to iterate on producing consistently-substantive distractors. Lessons with thin source material (very short raw_text) produce the weakest distractors — the model has less to work with.

## Reading order if you're new to the codebase

If you opened this repo cold, the path I'd suggest:

1. **`README.md`** — the front door.
2. **This file (`ARCHITECTURE.md`).**
3. **`backend/core/model_router.py`** — small but distinctive. Shows the three-model architecture in one screen.
4. **`backend/agents/summarization_agent.py`** — the most defended file. Each layer's comment names the captured failure mode it exists to handle.
5. **`backend/core/ingestion_pipeline.py`** — the orchestrator.
6. **`backend/agents/validation_agent.py` + `backend/agents/judge_agent.py`** — the two pure-Python gates that anchor the Deterministic Scaffold.
7. **`backend/agents/audit_agent.py`** — the self-improving loop, including the two stability guards.
8. **`frontend/src/components/GraphPanel.jsx`** — the most architecturally interesting frontend file. Force layers, pulse system, audit tethers, force boundary.
9. **`frontend/src/components/AboutPanel.jsx`** — the in-app user-facing explanation. Comparable scope to this document, different voice.
10. Whatever else catches your eye.

Done in that order, you'll have a complete picture of the system in about an hour.
