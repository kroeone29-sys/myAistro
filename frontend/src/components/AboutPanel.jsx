          <p>
            Everything in my-AI-stro orbits one data abstraction: the{" "}
            <strong>Source of Truth</strong>, or SOT.
          </p>
          <p>
            A SOT entry is the canonical record of one lesson. It holds the
            raw text you pasted in, plus everything extracted from it — a
            prose summary, a list of key concepts, term-definition pairs,
            verbatim code blocks, validation metadata, and timestamps.
            Entries are stored under the key{" "}
            <Code>(course, week, lesson)</Code>, so re-ingesting the same
            lesson replaces the old record cleanly.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single lesson can have <strong>multiple active versions</strong>{" "}
            — that's how the self-improving loop works (see below). The
            oldest active version is always <strong>canonical</strong> — what
            every other surface in the app reads. Newer versions live in the
            background, get scored, and either become canonical themselves or
            land in the Archives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SOT is one JSON file on your Mac. No database. No cloud
            sync. Atomic writes so a crash mid-write can't corrupt anything.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="How a lesson becomes part of my-AI-stro">
          <p>
            When you paste a lesson into the Ingest modal, it travels a
            five-stage pipeline before joining the SOT:
          </p>

          <PipelineDiagram
            stages={[
              "graph_entry",
              "retrieval",
              "summarization",
              "validation",
              "memory_write",
            ]}
          />

          <p>
            <strong>Graph entry</strong> records the trace and timestamp.{" "}
            <strong>Retrieval</strong> is currently a pass-through (kept for
            future context-aware ingestion).{" "}
            <strong>Summarization</strong> is the heavy lift: the raw text
            goes to llama3:8b with a tight prompt that returns structured
            JSON with defenses layered against every captured failure mode.{" "}
            <strong>Validation</strong> is the gatekeeper — a pure-Python
            rule-based check that rejects raw-JSON-as-summary, requires
            key concepts on non-trivial lessons, and inspects each
            extracted item against the raw lesson. Key concepts and
            definitions that don't appear as a substring (or even a
            shared token of four-plus characters) in the source get
            dropped before write — hallucinated bullets never enter the
            SOT. If more than 60% of the extracted items fail the
            grounding check, the whole entry is rejected. Failures
            don't write. <strong>Memory write</strong> commits the
            entry, syncs the Obsidian vault mirror, and emits a
            completion event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole pipeline streams back as NDJSON so you watch each
            stage light up live on the data-flow canvas. If validation
            fails, the entry is rejected with the specific errors logged.
          </p>

        <Section title="The agents at work">
          <p>
            my-AI-stro has eleven named agents. Each does exactly one thing.
          </p>
          <AgentTable />
          <p>
            Three design principles in that roster worth naming explicitly.
            First, <strong>LLM-as-judge separation</strong>: the model
            that generates a thing is never the model that grades it
            (Quiz uses llama3.2 to generate questions and mistral to
            grade your answers). Second,{" "}
            <strong>deterministic where deterministic is honest</strong>:
            validation and audit scoring are pure Python. No model
            variance gets to decide whether an entry survives. Third,{" "}
            <strong>trust isolation around the SOT</strong>: the model
            responsible for summarizing lessons into the canonical
            knowledge base does only that. It doesn't also handle
            ungrounded general chat. Ollama calls are stateless, so the
            cost of sharing weights wouldn't be runtime — it would be
            epistemic. The "this entry was carefully extracted" claim
            is stronger when the same weights aren't also free-
            associating elsewhere in the app.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="The deterministic scaffold">
          <p>
            Four of the eleven agents above don't run an LLM at all.
            Neither does the orchestrator that runs them. That's
            deliberate: every LLM call in my-AI-stro is wrapped in a
            deterministic Python fence that decides what to do with its
            output.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Validation</strong> is the gate between summarization
            and the SOT. A pure-Python function with rule checks against
            the raw lesson: rejects raw-JSON-as-summary (a known LLM
            fallback failure), requires key concepts on non-trivial
            lessons, requires substantive summary length, and — the
            strongest defense — inspects every extracted key concept
            and definition against the raw lesson text. Items that
            don't appear as a substring (or share at least one
            four-plus-character token) get dropped before write;
            entries where more than 60% of items fail that check are
            rejected outright. Hallucinated bullets never enter the
            SOT.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Judge</strong> is the gate between the audit
            cycle's alternative versions and what stays canonical.
            Originally an LLM (mistral); in practice mistral returned
            10/10 for nearly every summary regardless of measurable
            quality differences, defeating the entire audit cycle. The
            pure-Python rewrite scores each version on a fixed formula:
          </p>
          <FormulaBlock>
{`score = grounded_kc   × 5   −  ungrounded_kc   × 2
      + grounded_defs × 3   −  ungrounded_defs × 1
      + code_blocks   × 2
      + min(summary_len, 800) × 0.05`}
          </FormulaBlock>
          <p>
            Same inputs, same score, every time. No model drift. No
            Ollama call. Ungrounded items don't just fail to add —
            they subtract. Padding the summary with concepts the lesson
            never mentions can't beat staying anchored to the source,
            and the math says so plainly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The orchestrator</strong> runs the five-stage
            ingestion pipeline as a fixed sequence with typed event
            handoffs. Each stage produces an event the next stage
            consumes. If validation fails, memory_write never runs. If
            summarization throws, the pipeline halts and the error is
            preserved for the user to see. There is no "agent loop"
            choosing what to do next — the control flow is a switch
            statement. The audit loop is the same shape: pick the next
            lesson, route to score-and-archive vs. create-new-version,
            suppress churning lessons, skip stable groups. The
            decisions are control flow; the LLM is summoned only when
            it has something useful to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            The read side runs the same shape — see{" "}
            <em>The advisor pipeline</em> below for the full breakdown.
            Both pipelines emit identical NDJSON event vocabularies;
            both ride the same observability layer in the UI. The
            pattern is now used twice, deliberately.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Memory Writer</strong> is the gate to the file
            system itself. Atomic temp-file-and-rename writes so a
            crash mid-write can't corrupt the SOT. Upsert by{" "}
            <Code>(course, week, lesson)</Code> so re-ingesting cleans
            up rather than duplicating. Obsidian vault sync as a side
            effect after successful commit, never before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those four gates protect the SOT itself. Two more gates
            carry the same pattern to the persistent layers downstream
            of it — the Notebook and the Teacher Aide's plans:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Notebook gate</strong> verifies each saved
            advisor section against the source SOT entry it was
            assembled from — same substring + token-match logic,
            shared with validation through{" "}
            <Code>core/grounding_check.py</Code>. The result is
            attached as a <Code>grounding_report</Code> per section
            at save time, so the UI chips each saved section with its
            ratio (green ≥ 70%, yellow ≥ 50%, red &lt; 50%) and the
            Teacher Aide downstream sees the quality signal it should
            trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Teacher plan gate</strong> runs the same
            combined check on generated lesson plans against the
            source they were built from — either a SOT entry or a
            Notebook section, depending on which entry path triggered
            the generation. Structural validation still hard-blocks
            on malformed plans; grounding is a soft signal (warning
            below 0.5 overall_ratio) that persists with the saved
            plan so the Classroom UI can surface low-grounding plans
            rather than play them silently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scaffold is where the system gets its reliability. The
            LLM generates — fluently, usefully, occasionally with
            material that wasn't in the source. The deterministic
            gates around it decide what survives: validation refuses
            bad output at the SOT boundary, the Judge picks between
            alternatives during audit, the orchestrator decides when
            the model runs at all, Memory Writer commits only what
            passed every prior check, the Notebook gate verifies what
            the advisor saved, the plan gate verifies what the Teacher
            Aide produced. The system doesn't trust any single LLM
            call. It trusts the structure those calls flow through —
            and that structure now extends uniformly to every
            persistent artifact derived from the SOT.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="The self-improving audit loop">
          <p>
            Most personal-knowledge tools treat the first capture of a
            lesson as final. my-AI-stro doesn't. Every 15 minutes, the
            audit agent picks a lesson with room to grow, runs its{" "}
            <Code>raw_text</Code> back through the summarization pipeline,
            and appends a new version of the same lesson to the SOT.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a lesson accumulates three active versions, the Judge
            (the deterministic scorer described above) ranks all three.
            The weakest goes to the Archives — but only when there's a
            clear winner. If the bottom two scores sit within five
            points of each other, the audit recognizes the model has
            converged and leaves the group alone: no archive, no
            re-roll, no wasted compute on a near-tie. If a lesson has
            been archived more than once in the last 24 hours, it gets
            suppressed until the window slides. The loop refuses to
            churn lessons it can't improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the oldest active version is canonical (what every
            other surface reads), the system naturally rotates toward
            richer, more-grounded summaries over time as weaker
            originals get archived. You don't tune it. You don't tell
            it which version is better. It just runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            What you have is a knowledge representation that quietly
            gets denser the longer it sits on your machine, and stops
            trying when it's already as dense as the source allows. The
            Archives tab is the record of that process — there's a{" "}
            <strong>Run audit step</strong> button there if you want to
            fast-forward one cycle and watch the judge work.

        <Section title="The advisor pipeline">
          <p>
            my-AI-stro Chat — the natural-language query interface over
            your SOT — runs on its own pipeline, architecturally
            parallel to the ingestion pipeline. Same streaming-NDJSON
            event model, same stage-by-stage discipline. Where
            ingestion turns raw text into one validated SOT entry, the
            advisor turns one user question into a study guide
            assembled from N entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each query flows through a fixed sequence:
          </p>
          <PipelineDiagram
            stages={[
              "retrieval",
              "arc",
              "section ×N",

          <p>
            <strong>Retrieval</strong> selects relevant canonical SOT
            entries via course/week-aware filtering plus keyword
            overlap. Audit-generated satellites are filtered out —
            the advisor never weighs duplicate versions of the same
            lesson.{" "}
            <strong>Arc</strong> is one focused LLM call that reads
            the matched lesson list and writes a 2-4 sentence opening
            paragraph naming the conceptual journey across the
            lessons; skipped for single-entry queries.{" "}
            <strong>Section ×N</strong> is the map step — one LLM
            call per retrieved entry, each producing a single
            study-guide section with markdown header, key concepts,
            definitions, and verbatim code samples.{" "}
            <strong>Recap</strong> mirrors the arc at the other end:
            a short closing paragraph naming what the user should now
            understand.{" "}
            <strong>Assembly</strong> is pure Python — string
            concatenation of the streamed tokens in arrival order.
            No second LLM call.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why per-section instead of one big LLM call?</strong>{" "}
            The previous single-shot design fed all N entries to one
            call with a fixed output budget and produced three
            measurable failure modes. Code samples got compressed
            away — heavy in tokens, easy to cut. Per-lesson grounding
            occasionally drifted, e.g. the model once inverted a "use
            stable id, not array index" lesson into its opposite. And
            depth-per-lesson was uneven, depending on what the model
            chose to compress. Per-section processing fixes all three:
            each lesson gets its own output budget, each section's
            prompt sees only that one lesson so grounding errors stay
            localized, and the structure is consistent run-to-run
            because every section runs the same template.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why deterministic assembly instead of an LLM reduce?</strong>{" "}
            The arc and recap are LLM calls, but they're scoped
            reduces — each works only from the lesson list (titles +
            summaries), never from the per-section content. A bad arc
            or recap affects only that one paragraph; sections are
            unaffected. Final assembly is pure Python. A reduce step
            that read all N sections would be exactly the place to
            hallucinate cross-lesson claims the system has no source
            for — so the system doesn't take that risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The architectural unification matters.</strong>{" "}
            Both pipelines emit the same event vocabulary
            (<Code>step_start</Code>, <Code>step_complete</Code>,{" "}
            <Code>token</Code>, <Code>done</Code>,{" "}
            <Code>error</Code>). Both ride the same observability
            layer in the UI — the ingest pipeline lights up the Data
            Flow canvas; the advisor pipeline drives a live staging
            strip showing "section 3 of 9 · Conditional rendering"
            above the response. The pattern is now used twice,
            deliberately. When a third streaming multi-stage
            operation appears — batch re-summarization, course-wide
            re-grounding, anything that fits the shape — it plugs in
            at the same event model. The first use was scaffolding;
            the second use proves it's a system pattern.

            The five core surfaces aren't five parallel modes of
            access. They're a single workflow with a clear direction.
            Each surface listens to the one before it and produces
            the input the next one needs:
          </p>
          <FormulaBlock>
{`Ingest  →  SOT (List view)  →  my-AI-stro Chat  →  Notebook  →  Classroom`}
          </FormulaBlock>
          <ul style={listStyle}>
            <li>
              <strong>Ingest</strong> — paste a raw lesson. The
              five-stage pipeline turns it into a validated SOT entry.
              Hallucinated content is dropped by the validation gate
              before the entry ever reaches disk; failures don't write.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>List view</strong> — read the SOT directly. The
              structured summary, key concepts, definitions, code
              blocks, original raw text. The reference layer; the SOT
              exposed as a browsable library. Where you go when you
              want to read the source, not interpretations of it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>my-AI-stro Chat</strong> — query. The advisor
              pipeline retrieves relevant SOT entries, writes an
              opening arc, generates one focused section per entry,
              then a closing recap. Streams live with a staging
              indicator showing section-by-section progress. The
              advisor refuses to invent material you haven't actually
              learned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Notebook</strong> — save what's worth keeping.
              An advisor response becomes a persistent snapshot — same
              markdown, same syntax-highlighted code, same structure —
              viewable later without re-running the 3-4 minute
              pipeline. Each saved section keeps a clickable reference
              back to its source SOT lesson, plus a grounding ratio
              showing how anchored its content stayed to the source.
              Notes are user-curated artifacts, explicitly not part
              of the SOT itself: the SOT is "what I learned"; the
              Notebook is "what I asked the advisor to assemble from
              what I learned." Saved sections become the input the
              next stage consumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Classroom</strong> — be taught. Lists every
              saved Notebook section as a teachable unit. Click any
              one to start a beat-by-beat session built specifically
              for that lesson. Sections you've already taught from
              show <strong>▶ Resume</strong> (the cached plan loads
              instantly); fresh ones show <strong>🎓 Teach</strong>{" "}
              (~30 seconds for the Teacher Aide to draft a plan and
              Python-validate it against the section). The Teacher
              plays the plan beat-by-beat on a chalkboard — intro,
              exposition, examples, CHECK questions, recap. CHECK
              answers get graded; the teacher gives warm,
              source-specific corrections. A secondary "Browse all
              lessons →" link still lets you teach a SOT lesson you
              haven't saved yet — the one-off escape hatch.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Two auxiliary surfaces sit off the chain — they read from
            the SOT (or in one case, from nowhere) but don't produce
            inputs for any other stage:
          </p>
          <ul style={listStyle}>
            <li>
              <strong>Quiz Me</strong> — recall test. A question is
              generated from a SOT entry; you answer; the grader
              scores 0–100 with itemized corrections. Doesn't persist
              a learning artifact — it's exercise, not curation. Uses
              llama3.2 to generate the question and mistral to grade
              the answer (the LLM-as-judge separation rule in action).

              <strong>General Chat</strong> — untethered conversation.
              No SOT grounding. Routed to llama3.2, explicitly NOT
              the summarization model (trust isolation). For when you
              want to ask the model anything without being constrained
              by your notes.

              <strong>Spaced-repetition surfacing.</strong> The audit loop
              already produces a deterministic richness score per version.
              The Classroom session records already capture which CHECK
              questions a student got wrong. Combine those signals and the
              system can start scheduling specific lessons for re-study at

              <strong>Cross-lesson synthesis in Classroom.</strong> The
              Teacher Aide currently builds plans from one SOT entry.
              Letting it pull from multiple related entries unlocks real
              curriculum-style teaching.

              <strong>Improv-mode Classroom.</strong> V2 of the Teacher
              could generate beat content at runtime, handle raise-hand
              questions, re-explain on demand. The plan already supports
              this; only the runtime gap remains.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            None of these are committed. They're the natural extensions the
