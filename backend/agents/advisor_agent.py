"""
Advisor Agent — second downstream SOT consumer.

Takes a user's natural-language query and a list of relevant SOT
entries, builds a grounded prompt, and streams the model's tokens
as they arrive.

Strict rule: the agent must answer from the SOT entries only. If the
SOT doesn't cover the question, it should say so rather than
hallucinating material the user hasn't actually learned.
