Teacher Agent — runtime classroom interactions.

V1 was correction-phrasing only — `phrase_correction` runs after the
grader scores a CHECK, generating short warm commentary on what the
student got right or missed.

V2 (this version) adds the first of the originally-named v2 features:
RAISE-HAND ANSWERS. The student can ask a question mid-session and the
teacher answers grounded in the same lesson's source material. This
extends the Teacher from "phrase a correction" to "answer questions in
the source," but keeps the same trust contract — every output is
grounded in material the student has actually seen.

Still planned (future v2 work):
  - Re-explain on demand: alternative phrasing of the current beat
  - Improv content generation: adaptive beats based on student state
    (e.g. remedial EXPOSITION after a failed CHECK)

The new functions stream tokens (matching the advisor + audit pattern)
so the runtime interactions feel responsive, not "wait 10 seconds for
the teacher to think."

    Yield content chunks for a student's mid-session "raise hand"
    question. The Teacher reads the lesson's source material and
    answers the question — grounded strictly in that source, brief
    enough not to derail the flow.

    Strict rule: if the question can't be answered from the source,
    the teacher says so plainly. The contract is the same as the
    advisor's — never invent material the student hasn't actually
    learned. The Python grounding gate at the controller (combined
    report against `source_text`) verifies what the LLM produces
    after the stream completes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    question : str
        The student's typed question.
    source_text : str
        The lesson material the answer must be grounded in. Resolved
        by the controller from the Plan's lesson_event_id (for plans
        generated from SOT) or derived_from_notebook section
        (for plans generated from a Notebook section).
    course / week / lesson : str
        Identity for the prompt header. Optional but improves the
        Teacher's sense of context.
