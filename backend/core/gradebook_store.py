"""
Gradebook store — append-only log of per-CHECK results from Classroom
sessions, plus eventually Quiz attempts in Phase 3.

Phase 2 of the gradebook arc. This module is the data layer only — no
aggregation, no API endpoints, no UI. Its single job is to start the
data clock so that when the gradebook UI ships (Phase 4), there's
real history to display.

Storage:
  backend/gradebook.json — one file, `{version, records: [...]}` shape.
  Atomic temp+rename writes via the same pattern as classroom_store.
  Threading lock against concurrent writes. Single-file is fine at
  personal-tool scale (a year of heavy daily use is on the order of
  thousands of records — small enough to rewrite on every append).

Record shape:
  {
    "type":             "classroom_check",   # discriminator; Phase 3
                                             # adds "quiz_attempt"
    "ts":               "2026-05-27T...",    # ISO-8601 UTC
    "session_id":       str,
    "plan_id":          str,

                                             # without an event_id on
                                             # the section
    "course":           str,
    "week":             str,
    "lesson":           str,
    "beat_id":          str,
    "selected_index":   int,                 # canonical (against plan
                                             # order, not display order)
    "correct_index":    int,
    "passed":           bool,
    "score":            0 | 100,             # deterministic MC grade
    "first_try":        bool,                # mastery signal
  }

Design notes:
  - Records are written immediately after the session event is
    persisted, so a write here always corresponds to a real session
    event on disk. If the controller crashes between update_session
    and record_check, the session has the event but the gradebook
    doesn't — that drift is fine (the gradebook UI can rebuild from
    session events if we ever need to), but the inverse never happens.
  - Guest path is NOT hooked. Visitor activity is ephemeral by design
    — they never get a session record either, and gradebook entries
    are personal-vault data.
  - Per-CHECK retries DO land here, marked with first_try=False. The
    aggregation rules (mastery = all CHECKs first-try, lesson grade =
    first-try-correct / total CHECKs, etc.) live in Phase 4's grading
    module, not here. This module just collects.
