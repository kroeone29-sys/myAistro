Notebook endpoints — save / list / fetch / delete advisor outputs.

Routes:
  POST   /api/notebook/save       body: SaveNoteRequest      (write-gated)
  GET    /api/notebook/list       summary list of all notes  (read-open)
  GET    /api/notebook/{id}       full note content          (read-open)
  DELETE /api/notebook/{id}                                  (write-gated)

The Notebook is the user's persistent library of saved advisor
outputs — see `core/notebook_store.py` for the full architectural
framing. This controller is intentionally thin: validation +
persistence delegation. No business logic lives here.
